/**
 * Which recorded swaps belong on screen in the currently-selected market.
 *
 * <p>AtomiX trades ONE currency at a time, but the swap DB is shared between both — so a history list that
 * simply renders every row shows the dollar market's swaps while you are looking at the Minima market (the
 * defect this class fixes: the combine gave the app two currencies without giving the history reads a scope).
 *
 * <p>The rule is "its own market, always; the other market only while still actionable". A swap in the OTHER
 * currency stays visible across markets while it is non-terminal AND inside its refund/claim window, because
 * settlement is deliberately currency-agnostic ({@link MinimaHtlc}) and hiding a leg you could still recover
 * could cost real funds. Once that window has long closed the row is not actionable from any screen, so it
 * drops back into its own currency's history instead of squatting in the other one forever.
 *
 * <p>Every unknown fails OPEN (shown): an unattributable legacy row, a missing timelock, or an unknown chain
 * tip all render. Showing a row you didn't need costs a line of screen; hiding one you did can cost money.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately Android-free and static so the whole rule is unit-testable (see SwapVisibilityTest).
