 * - Holds the single {@link MinimaAPI} instance (which auto-registers this app with the node).
 * - Runs node commands and delivers the result back ON THE MAIN THREAD (the raw SDK callback
 *   arrives on the broadcast-receiver thread), with a timeout so a missing/stopped node
 *   surfaces an error instead of hanging.
 * - Detects the "app not enabled in Minima Core" reply and routes it to a pairing listener
